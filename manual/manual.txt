= Using the Ferret Copy Detector (Version 5.3) =
:author: Peter Lane

== Overview ==

Ferret is a copy-detection tool, locating duplicate text or code in 
multiple text documents or source files.  Ferret is designed to  
detect copying ( _collusion_ ) within a given set of files.

*Ferret is useful for:*

- document analysis, tracking changes to documents
- software developers, looking for duplicate code to refactor
- software evolution, studying how code has changed over time
- teachers, looking for collusion or plagiarism in student work
- tracking the amount of new material in the current version of a text or program 

*Features:*

- compares text documents containing natural language or computer language
- automatic conversion of standard word processor or pdf formats to text
- processing specialised for major programming languages
- choice of similarity measures to highlight individual or group similarity
- quick loading and comparison of documents, up to computer's memory capacity
- display of _all_ document comparisons, ranked by a similarity score
- detailed display of _individual_ document comparisons, highlighting any text
  in common with the group or uniquely with compared document
- save result table and comparisons to pdf or xml formats, for printing or further analysis.
- display of unique trigrams per document/student

*Similarity Measure*

Ferret computes a similarity measure based on the trigrams found within each of
the two documents under comparison; this measure is a number from 0 (no
copying) to 1 (everything has been copied). This measure should _not_ be taken
as an absolute measure of the amount of copying. Instead, the measure is
intended to indicate the _relative_ amount of copying that the current pair has
compared with the rest of the group. Pairs which appear on top of the table of 
all similarity comparisons should be examined for possible copying, but the 
measure itself does not imply any reliable conclusion.

=== Supported Document Types ===

Ferret identifies the major word-processor formats and converts them to text 
automatically before further processing.  A wide selection of computer 
languages are also recognised, and tokenised in a manner specific to that 
language.  The recognised file types are:

- Text documents (.txt)
** Word processor formats (.doc, .docx, .rtf, .abw)
** Pdf documents (.pdf)
- Computer languages
** C/C++ (.h, .c, .cpp)
** C# (.cs)
** Clojure (.clj)
** Groovy (.groovy)
** Haskell (.hs, .lhs)
** Java (.java)
** Lisp (.lisp, .lsp)
** Prolog (.pl)
** Python (.py)
** Racket (.rkt)
** Ruby (.rb)
** Scheme (.scm, .ss)
** Visual Basic (.vb)
** XML/HTML (.xml, .html)


=== Installation ===

Installable versions for a range of operating systems are available from 
http://peterlane.info/ferret.html[]

The source code for Ferret is available at http://github.com/petercrlane/ferret[]
and may be downloaded and compiled on a platform of your choice.


== Ferret Application ==

The Ferret application, when run, presents the _Select Files_ dialog, as shown
in <<Figure_1,Figure 1>>.  This dialog invites the user to collect together a
list of documents for comparison.  Documents and directories can be added to
the list using the 'Add ...' buttons.  Alternatively, documents and directories
can be dragged from a file selector, and dropped onto the list.

[[Figure_1]]

Figure 1: Select Files dialog.

To remove documents and start again click on the button 'Clear Documents'.  

The 'Settings' button opens up a dialog allowing the user to change some 
of the ways in which documents are processed.  There are four settings to 
change.

When converting files, Ferret will save the files into the named folder.  The
user can direct Ferret to use a different folder using the 'Browse ...' button.
This option is particularly useful for collecting together files from multiple
folders into one place.  Ferret will only copy the converted files to the
destination folder; check the first box if you want every file to be copied.

If you want every file to be treated as a word/rtf file (for example, with
mislabelled student or pupil work), check the second box.

If you want to ignore any unknown files (for example, output from compilers or
image files), check the third box.  (Ferret's initial settings mean it will
ignore unknown filetypes, so uncheck if you want Ferret to process all files.)

The check box for 'Group files in directories' is only available if you only
select directories in the list of documents or directories for comparison.  If
you check this box, then files within each shown directory will _not_ be
compared with each other.  Also, certain displays will use results from all
files within the directory in aggregate, such as the display of unique trigrams
(see below).  This option may be used where each directory represents a
separate student's submissions, and the user wants to know how each student
compares with other students.  Alternatively, each directory may represent a
different version of a developing project, and the user wants to compare
versions over time.

=== Processing the Documents ===

Once you have selected the documents or directories, you need to click on the 
button 'Run Ferret'; this option is only available if at least two documents 
have been selected.  Any documents in word-processor or pdf format will then 
automatically be converted to a plain text format, before analysing the 
similarities.  The progress bar indicates the expected amount of time. 
After processing has completed, a warning may come up if there were any rejected 
files; a detailed list of these rejected files is available in the report 
which can be generated from the Table of Comparisons, Figure 3.

=== Table of Comparisons ===

The Table of Comparisons is the central dialog within Ferret.  It holds the 
results of comparing all pairs of documents for similarity, and provides access 
to the other views and dialogs, through the buttons on the right-hand side.

The table itself has three columns.  The first two columns give the names of 
the files being compared.  The names are given in a short form, with any 
directory used when selecting the files preceding the name.  Uncheck the 
box for 'Show short names' to reveal the complete pathname of each file.

The third column gives the similarity score for the two documents.  This 
score is a number from 0 (no copying) to 1 (identical).  The similarity 
score provides a _relative_ measure of copying within the group of files, so 
pairs at the top of the table should be examined for copying.  In practice, 
we find similarity scores above 0.04 are likely to reveal significant 
copying, but this threshold should be taken as indicative only (see the papers 
listed below for discussion on this issue).

The table can be reordered, by clicking on the column headings or using the 
buttons on the right-hand side.  The table can also be saved to a pdf file 
using the 'Save Report ...' button; this report also includes information 
about the group of files compared and any rejected or problem files found 
during analysis.

=== Displaying the Results ===

Any pair of documents in the Table of Comparisons can be selected and
displayed, by clicking the button Show Analysis (marked with an arrow). This
display comes up as in Figures 4 and 4.  Figure 4 shows passages of copied
text with blocks of highlighted matches, contrasting with 4 which shows an
independently written text with a sprinkling of matching phrases.

=== Explanation of the display ===

In the top left window is the text of the first file, its name in the top left
corner, while below is the second file, again with its name in the top left
corner. Matching text is highlighted in both.  On the right is a list of
matching trigrams (3 word phrases). The analysis is based on matching trigrams.
To find corresponding matching sections in the two files you can select a
trigram (marked with an arrow), click on it, and the cursor will jump to the
appropriate points in the two files. If the button marked "Find" is active,
then clicking on it takes you to another occurrence of the same trigram.  4

Use the scroll bar on the right of each window to navigate up and down.  Note
how copied text can have words inserted, deleted or substituted, but still be
so similar that plagiarism is suspected.

=== Saving the display ===

The display can be saved by clicking the button Save Analysis, either in the
display window, or in the Table of Comparisons window. By default it will be
saved in the folder from which you selected the documents, or chose another
destination. Both files will be saved, with matching passages highlighted in
blue, or bold for black and white printing.

== Text Interface to Ferret ==

Ferret can be controlled from the command line, by providing it with 
input options.  The full range of options can be listed by running
+uhferret --help+ or +uh ferret -h+.

------------------------------------------------------------------
> uhferret --help
Ferret 5.3: start with no arguments for graphical version
Usage: ferret [-h] [-d] [-l] [-a] [-p] [-x] [-u]
  -h, --help           	displays help on command-line parameters
  -d, --data-table     	produce similarity table (default)
  -l, --list-trigrams  	produce trigram list report
  -a, --all-comparisons	produce list of all comparisons
  -p, --pdf-report     	source-1 source-2 results-file : create pdf report
  -x, --xml-report     	source-1 source-2 results-file : create xml report
  -f, --definition-file	use file with document list
  -u, --use-stored-data	store/retrieve data structure
------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice that all switches have both a long and a short form.  You can either 
write +uhferret --help+ or +uhferret -h+.  Switches cannot be combined.
To list trigrams with code documents:

-----------------------------
> uhferret -l -c filename1 ..
-----------------------------

Not all combinations of the different options make sense, and you may get 
unexpected results.  For example, you cannot use a definition file with the 
option to produce a pdf or xml report.  

=== Input documents ===

The simplest way of providing documents to Ferret is by listing them 
on the command line.  For example, to run Ferret on all the text documents 
in the current directory, call: +uhferret *.txt+

The default setting treats the documents as _natural-language text_.  To
process computer-language texts, you have to provide the _--code_ switch.
For symmetry, the _--text_ switch is also present to enforce
natural-language.

=== Output formats ===

==== Similarity table ====

The default option, also obtained with the switch +--data-table+, is to
provide a list of every pair of comparisons and their similarities.  This 
output format is used with a list of documents.

For example:

---------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -d *.txt
Number of documents: 4
Number of distinct trigrams: 678
text-1.txt ; text-2.txt ; 0 ; 194 ; 152 ; 0
text-1.txt ; text-3.txt ; 1 ; 194 ; 128 ; 0.00311526
text-1.txt ; text-4.txt ; 0 ; 194 ; 273 ; 0
text-2.txt ; text-3.txt ; 2 ; 152 ; 128 ; 0.00719424
text-2.txt ; text-4.txt ; 1 ; 152 ; 273 ; 0.00235849
text-3.txt ; text-4.txt ; 65 ; 128 ; 273 ; 0.193452
---------------------------------------------------

The output begins with some general information, about the number of documents
and number of distinct trigrams found.  A semicolon is used to separate 
the information, making the output easily parsable by a further program.  
Each line reports:

. name of file 1, 
. name of file 2, 
. number of common trigrams, 
. number of trigrams in file 1, 
. number of trigrams in file 2, and
. the similarity score.

For instance, text-3.txt has 128 trigrams, text-4.txt has 273 trigrams.  65 
of these trigrams are in common, giving a similarity score of 0.193452.

==== Trigram list ====

The switch +--list-trigrams+ is used to output a list of all the trigrams
within the provided documents, along with the documents in which they occur.  A
tab separates the trigram from the FILES identifier.

---------------------------------------
> uhferret -l *.txt
a programming language    FILES:[ 0 1 ]
a machine particularly    FILES:[ 0 2 ]
a computer such           FILES:[ 0 1 ]
a structured mechanism    FILES:[ 0 ]
a programmer to           FILES:[ 1 2 ]
a computation as          FILES:[ 0 ]
a collection of           FILES:[ 0 ]
...
---------------------------------------

This list can become quite long.  The FILES list the documents by indexing 
them in the order they appeared on the command line.

==== All Comparisons ====

The switch +--all-comparisons+ is used to output a table of all the 
similarity scores of each pair of documents.  This table is in CSV format 
and, size permitting, may be read into a spreadsheet package for further 
analysis.

---------------------------------------
> uhferret -a *.txt
, text-1.txt, text-2.txt, text-3.txt, text-4.txt
text-1.txt, 1.0, 0, 0.00311526, 0
text-2.txt, 0, 1.0, 0.00719424, 0.00235849
text-3.txt, 0.00311526, 0.00719424, 1.0, 0.193452
text-4.txt, 0, 0.00235849, 0.193452, 1.0
---------------------------------------

==== Html Table ====

The switch +--html-table+ is used to output the table of similarities of the
top 100 pairs in HTML format.  This option is only useful when Ferret is part
of a server package.

==== Individual reports ====

The switches +--pdf-report+ and +--xml-report+ are similar in 
instructing Ferret to provide a pdf or XML report of the comparison 
of two documents.  A style sheet is provided on comqpcl's website to 
display the XML output in a web browser.  

For example, to get a comparison of +text-1.txt+ and +text-2.txt+ in
pdf format, calling the pdf document +comparison.pdf+, you would call
Ferret with:

--------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -p text-1.txt text-2.txt comparison.pdf
--------------------------------------------------

The XML output is similar:

--------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -x text-1.txt text-2.txt comparison.xml
--------------------------------------------------


=== Storing internal dataset ===

The switch +--use-stored-data+ instructs Ferret to preserve its internal 
datastore in the given file.  This datastore can then be loaded later, so 
that documents can be compared against the original set of documents without 
the latter being present.

For instance:

------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -u text-data.dat text-1.txt text-2.txt
------------------------------------------------

will preserve information about documents +text-1.txt+ and 
+text-2.txt+ in the file {\tt text-data.dat}.  We can then compare new 
documents against these by providing Ferret with the name of the stored 
dataset:

------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -u text-data.dat text-3.txt test-4.txt
------------------------------------------------

+text-data.dat+ is also updated to include the new files.

=== Defining input document list ===

An alternative way of providing documents to ferret is to use a _file 
definition_.  This allows Ferret to read a list of files for processing from 
a text file, circumventing limitations in the number of permissable arguments 
on a command line.  Also, the file definition enables the user to separate 
documents into groups, so that documents within groups are not compared, but 
all pairs with documents in different groups are compared.

The command-line switch is: +--definition-file+

Example of use: +uhferret -f file-defn.dat+

Example of file definition:

-----------------------------------
START GROUP
text-1.txt
text-2.txt
END GROUP
text-3.txt
text-4.txt
-----------------------------------

This will compare +text-1.txt+ and +text-2.txt+ with +text-3.txt+
and +text-4.txt+, and +text-3.txt+ with +text-4.txt+, but
+text-1.txt+ and +text-2.txt+ will not be compared.

You can have as many groups as you need.  

== Ruby Gem ==

A Ruby wrapper around Ferret can be installed using:

----------------------
> gem install uhferret
----------------------

The Ruby wrapper provides a command-line interface, rather like +uhferret+ 
does, a web server version of Ferret, and a callable library for using 
Ferret in your own Ruby scripts, for more advanced processing.

=== Command Line ===

The command-line program is called +uhferret-ruby+, to distinguish it 
from the above +uhferret+ program.  The options are a subset of those 
available from +uhferret+, and function in the same way.

----------------------
Usage: uhferret-ruby [options] file1 file2 ...
    -h, --help                       help message
    -c, --code                       process documents as code
    -t, --text                       process documents as text (default)
    -d, --data-table                 output similarity table (default)
    -l, --list-trigrams              output trigram list
    -a, --all-comparisons            output list of all comparisons
    -x, --xml-report FILE            generate xml report from two documents
    -f, --definition-file FILE       read document names from file
----------------------

To compute the similarities of a set of files, use:

----------------------
> uhferret-ruby file1.txt file2.txt ...
----------------------

An xml output can be generated for a pair of files using:

----------------------
> uhferret-ruby -x outfile.xml file1.txt file2.txt
----------------------

The xml output can be displayed in a browser using the style sheet 
'uhferret.xsl' in the examples folder, and then printed from the browser.

=== Server ===

----------------------
Usage: start-uhferret-server [options]
    -h, --help                       help message
    -p, --port n                     port number
    -f, --folder FOLDER              base folder
----------------------

The folder to store the processed files will default to 
'FerretFiles' and the port to 2000.
Initial address: http://localhost:2000/ferret/home

NB: The server uses some *nix commands, and so currently does not work 
under Windows.
