= Using the Ferret Copy Detector (Version 5.2) =
:author: Peter Lane

== Overview ==

The Ferret copy detector takes a number of documents and finds similar passages
in any two. This version can be used for up to 300 documents of 10,000 words
each. It can be used for essays and reports, in English, or else a version for
programming code can be selected. Material from the web can be used for
comparison too. If you wish to use the Ferret on other European languages or on
Chinese please contact the authors via
http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/~pdgroup/ 

The similar passages do not have to be identical. This software is used for
detecting plagiarism in students' work where there may be an attempt to avoid
detection by changing some words and phrases.  

The steps in running the Ferret are: 

. Documents are pre-processed.  Diagrams and figures are ignored.  
. Comparison of each document with every other one is done.  
. Results are shown in a table with a measure of similarity between each pair.
. Any pair can be displayed side by side to show matching passages highlighted 

== Installation ==

Download from your disk or from http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/~pdgroup/
Follow the wizard taking you through the easy installation steps.  

== Ferret Application ==

Click on the Ferret icon to get the starting screen as shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1

Collect all the documents you want to analyse, and put them in one or more
folders.  They can be Word (suffix .doc), pdf (suffix .pdf), rich text (suffix
.rtf) or text (suffix .txt).  Acceptable suffixes also include .tex, .html, and
programming code such as .java. Documents of other types, such as .xls and zip
files, will be rejected.  Click on button Add Documents (marked with arrow) to
get your documents. Use the browser to get to the folder(s) where you have
collected your documents. Tip: to select all documents in a folder, type Ctrl
A. Having selected your documents you have a screen as in Figure 2 There is
usually no need to go to the button Further settings for comparing text
documents. Go to Help for an explanation of the use of these further settings.

To remove documents and start again click on button Clear Documents.  

=== Processing the Documents ===

If you have selected the documents you want then click on button Run Ferret
(marked with an arrow).  The documents will first be converted to .txt format.
On a standard desk top or laptop computer this typically takes about 2 minutes
for 80 documents, as shown by the progress bar.  If any files are rejected this
is reported. It is important to look at the report at the end of the process to
see which files are rejected, as these may be suspicious ones.  Then each file
is compared with every other one. This typically takes a few seconds.  The
Table of Comparison then appears, as in Figure 3, with the most similar pairs
at the top. (All the documents now have the suffix.txt)

Figure 3

=== Explanation of the Table ===

The first and second columns give the names of the files being compared. The
third column headed Similarity gives a measure of the similarity of the
documents, between 0 and 1. Two identical documents will have a score of 1. In
practice, we find that a Similarity score below 0.04 shows that two documents
are probably written independently, while above 0.04 the two documents should
be examined further. However, if students have inserted text given by the
lecturer, such as the wording of a question or other comments, the threshold
will be higher. In the case shown in Figure 3 the threshold was 0.06 The
documents are listed in ranked order of similarity, with the most similar at
the top. You can reorder on first or second column - for instance to find a
certain document pair you will want them in alphabetical or numerical order -
by clicking on button Document 1 or Document 2. Use the scroll bar on the side
of the window to find entries lower down.  At the bottom of the Table you can
see how many documents are being analysed, and how many pairs this produces.
To save this table click on the Save Report button. The default is to send it
to the folder from which you selected documents, or chose another destination.
Note this file can be large: it will have the same number of entries as number
of pairs. 

If some files have been rejected at the file conversion stage because they are
not of the right sort a message will be given in the report.  

=== Displaying the Results ===

Any pair of documents in the Table of Comparisons can be selected and
displayed, by clicking the button Show Analysis (marked with an arrow). This
display comes up as in Figures 4 and 4.  Figure 4 shows passages of copied
text with blocks of highlighted matches, contrasting with 4 which shows an
independently written text with a sprinkling of matching phrases.

=== Explanation of the display ===

In the top left window is the text of the first file, its name in the top left
corner, while below is the second file, again with its name in the top left
corner. Matching text is highlighted in both.  On the right is a list of
matching trigrams (3 word phrases). The analysis is based on matching trigrams.
To find corresponding matching sections in the two files you can select a
trigram (marked with an arrow), click on it, and the cursor will jump to the
appropriate points in the two files. If the button marked "Find" is active,
then clicking on it takes you to another occurrence of the same trigram.  4

Use the scroll bar on the right of each window to navigate up and down.  Note
how copied text can have words inserted, deleted or substituted, but still be
so similar that plagiarism is suspected.

=== Saving the display ===

The display can be saved by clicking the button Save Analysis, either in the
display window, or in the Table of Comparisons window. By default it will be
saved in the folder from which you selected the documents, or chose another
destination. Both files will be saved, with matching passages highlighted in
blue, or bold for black and white printing.

== Text Interface to Ferret ==

Ferret can be controlled from the command line, by providing it with 
input options.  The full range of options can be listed by running
+uhferret --help+ or +uh ferret -h+.

------------------------------------------------------------------
> uhferret --help
Ferret 5.2: start with no arguments for graphical version
Usage: ferret [-h] [-t] [-c] [-d] [-l] [-a] [-w] [-p] [-x] [-u]
  -h, --help           	displays help on command-line parameters
  -t, --text           	text document type (default)
  -c, --code           	code document type
  -d, --data-table     	produce similarity table (default)
  -l, --list-trigrams  	produce trigram list report
  -a, --all-comparisons	produce list of all comparisons
  -w, --html-table     	produce similarity table in html format
  -p, --pdf-report     	source-1 source-2 results-file : create pdf report
  -x, --xml-report     	source-1 source-2 results-file : create xml report
  -f, --definition-file	use file with document list
  -u, --use-stored-data	store/retrieve data structure
------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice that all switches have both a long and a short form.  You can either 
write +uhferret --help+ or +uhferret -h+.  Switches cannot be combined.
To list trigrams with code documents:

+uhferret -l -c filename1 .. +

Not all combinations of the different options make sense, and you may get 
unexpected results.  For example, you cannot use a definition file with the 
option to produce a pdf or xml report.  

=== Input documents ===

The simplest way of providing documents to Ferret is by listing them 
on the command line.  For example, to run Ferret on all the text documents 
in the current directory, call: +uhferret *.txt+

The default setting treats the documents as _natural-language text_.  To
process computer-language texts, you have to provide the _--code_ switch.
For symmetry, the _--text_ switch is also present to enforce
natural-language.

=== Output formats ===

==== Similarity table ====

The default option, also obtained with the switch +--data-table+, is to
provide a list of every pair of comparisons and their similarities.  This 
output format is used with a list of documents.

For example:

---------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -d *.txt
Number of documents: 4
Number of distinct trigrams: 678
text-1.txt ; text-2.txt ; 0 ; 194 ; 152 ; 0
text-1.txt ; text-3.txt ; 1 ; 194 ; 128 ; 0.00311526
text-1.txt ; text-4.txt ; 0 ; 194 ; 273 ; 0
text-2.txt ; text-3.txt ; 2 ; 152 ; 128 ; 0.00719424
text-2.txt ; text-4.txt ; 1 ; 152 ; 273 ; 0.00235849
text-3.txt ; text-4.txt ; 65 ; 128 ; 273 ; 0.193452
---------------------------------------------------

The output begins with some general information, about the number of documents
and number of distinct trigrams found.  A semicolon is used to separate 
the information, making the output easily parsable by a further program.  
Each line reports:

. name of file 1, 
. name of file 2, 
. number of common trigrams, 
. number of trigrams in file 1, 
. number of trigrams in file 2, and
. the similarity score.

For instance, text-3.txt has 128 trigrams, text-4.txt has 273 trigrams.  65 
of these trigrams are in common, giving a similarity score of 0.193452.

==== Trigram list ====

The switch +--list-trigrams+ is used to output a list of all the trigrams
within the provided documents, along with the documents in which they occur.  A
tab separates the trigram from the FILES identifier.

---------------------------------------
> uhferret -l *.txt
a programming language    FILES:[ 0 1 ]
a machine particularly    FILES:[ 0 2 ]
a computer such           FILES:[ 0 1 ]
a structured mechanism    FILES:[ 0 ]
a programmer to           FILES:[ 1 2 ]
a computation as          FILES:[ 0 ]
a collection of           FILES:[ 0 ]
...
---------------------------------------

This list can become quite long.  The FILES list the documents by indexing 
them in the order they appeared on the command line.

==== All Comparisons ====

The switch +--all-comparisons+ is used to output a table of all the 
similarity scores of each pair of documents.  This table is in CSV format 
and, size permitting, may be read into a spreadsheet package for further 
analysis.

---------------------------------------
> uhferret -a *.txt
, text-1.txt, text-2.txt, text-3.txt, text-4.txt
text-1.txt, 1.0, 0, 0.00311526, 0
text-2.txt, 0, 1.0, 0.00719424, 0.00235849
text-3.txt, 0.00311526, 0.00719424, 1.0, 0.193452
text-4.txt, 0, 0.00235849, 0.193452, 1.0
---------------------------------------

==== Html Table ====

The switch +--html-table+ is used to output the table of similarities of the
top 100 pairs in HTML format.  This option is only useful when Ferret is part
of a server package.

==== Individual reports ====

The switches +--pdf-report+ and +--xml-report+ are similar in 
instructing Ferret to provide a pdf or XML report of the comparison 
of two documents.  A style sheet is provided on comqpcl's website to 
display the XML output in a web browser.  

For example, to get a comparison of +text-1.txt+ and +text-2.txt+ in
pdf format, calling the pdf document +comparison.pdf+, you would call
Ferret with:

--------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -p text-1.txt text-2.txt comparison.pdf
--------------------------------------------------

The XML output is similar:

--------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -x text-1.txt text-2.txt comparison.xml
--------------------------------------------------


=== Storing internal dataset ===

The switch +--use-stored-data+ instructs Ferret to preserve its internal 
datastore in the given file.  This datastore can then be loaded later, so 
that documents can be compared against the original set of documents without 
the latter being present.

For instance:

------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -u text-data.dat text-1.txt text-2.txt
------------------------------------------------

will preserve information about documents +text-1.txt+ and 
+text-2.txt+ in the file {\tt text-data.dat}.  We can then compare new 
documents against these by providing Ferret with the name of the stored 
dataset:

------------------------------------------------
> uhferret -u text-data.dat text-3.txt test-4.txt
------------------------------------------------

+text-data.dat+ is also updated to include the new files.

=== Defining input document list ===

An alternative way of providing documents to ferret is to use a _file 
definition_.  This allows Ferret to read a list of files for processing from 
a text file, circumventing limitations in the number of permissable arguments 
on a command line.  Also, the file definition enables the user to separate 
documents into groups, so that documents within groups are not compared, but 
all pairs with documents in different groups are compared.

The command-line switch is: +--definition-file+

Example of use: +uhferret -f file-defn.dat+

Example of file definition:

-----------------------------------
START GROUP
text-1.txt
text-2.txt
END GROUP
text-3.txt
text-4.txt
-----------------------------------

This will compare +text-1.txt+ and +text-2.txt+ with +text-3.txt+
and +text-4.txt+, and +text-3.txt+ with +text-4.txt+, but
+text-1.txt+ and +text-2.txt+ will not be compared.

You can have as many groups as you need.  You _must_ provide the file type,
if you want to specify that Ferret treat the documents as program code.

== Ruby Gem ==

A Ruby wrapper around Ferret can be installed using:

----------------------
> gem install uhferret
----------------------

The Ruby wrapper provides a command-line interface, rather like +uhferret+ 
does, a web server version of Ferret, and a callable library for using 
Ferret in your own Ruby scripts, for more advanced processing.

=== Command Line ===

The command-line program is called +uhferret-ruby+, to distinguish it 
from the above +uhferret+ program.  The options are a subset of those 
available from +uhferret+, and function in the same way.

----------------------
Usage: uhferret-ruby [options] file1 file2 ...
    -h, --help                       help message
    -c, --code                       process documents as code
    -t, --text                       process documents as text (default)
    -d, --data-table                 output similarity table (default)
    -l, --list-trigrams              output trigram list
    -a, --all-comparisons            output list of all comparisons
    -x, --xml-report FILE            generate xml report from two documents
    -f, --definition-file FILE       read document names from file
----------------------

To compute the similarities of a set of files, use:

----------------------
> uhferret-ruby file1.txt file2.txt ...
----------------------

An xml output can be generated for a pair of files using:

----------------------
> uhferret-ruby -x outfile.xml file1.txt file2.txt
----------------------

The xml output can be displayed in a browser using the style sheet 
'uhferret.xsl' in the examples folder, and then printed from the browser.

=== Server ===

----------------------
Usage: start-uhferret-server [options]
    -h, --help                       help message
    -p, --port n                     port number
    -f, --folder FOLDER              base folder
----------------------

The folder to store the processed files will default to 
'FerretFiles' and the port to 2000.
Initial address: http://localhost:2000/ferret/home

NB: The server uses some *nix commands, and so currently does not work 
under Windows.
